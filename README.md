# DHIS2 blocks

This repository is a pnpm and Turborepo monorepo for reusable DHIS2 UI blocks
and the applications used to develop them.

## Workspace layout

packages/
  blocks/
    context-selector/   Capture-style controlled context-selector primitives

e2e/                    Real-DHIS2 Playwright coverage
scripts/e2e/            Real-DHIS2 environment orchestration
```

The web application depends on the private block workspaces through pnpm's
`workspace:*` protocol. Each workspace package resolves directly to its source
entry point, so the demo, tests, and production application build all exercise
the same canonical source.

## Setup

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Development application

```sh
pnpm start
```

This starts the DHIS2 custom wrapper from `apps/web`. Working List source
changes receive hot updates without a separate library build. By default the
DHIS2 Application Platform opens the application at
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The interactive Context Selector primitive showcase is available at
`#/context-selector-showcase` and from the link at the bottom of the demo.

The deployable application bundle is built with:

```sh
pnpm build
```

The DHIS2 application output is written below `apps/web/build`.

## Context Selector block

The Context Selector is a source-installed, Capture-style composition layer for
the application context row. Install it from the GitHub registry in a project
with Tailwind CSS enabled and a valid shadcn `components.json` configuration:

```sh
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add devotta-labs/dhis2-blocks/context-selector
```

Import the installed source through the project's configured components alias:

```tsx
import {
    ContextSelector,
    EnrollmentSelector,
    EventSelector,
    OrganisationUnitSelector,
    ProgramSelector,
    StageSelector,
} from '@/components/context-selector'
```

`ContextSelector` owns the row's Capture-compatible layout, styling, and
semantics. Its children are independently composable controlled controls. The
host supplies all option data, selected values, availability state, popup
content, and callbacks; it also chooses which controls render and in what
order. The block does not fetch data, synchronize a router or URL, own workflow
state, or decide when progressive disclosure advances.

A program-first application can initially render only
`ProgramSelector`, then add organisation-unit, enrollment, stage, and event
children as its own context policy makes them relevant. All values, direct
callbacks, and metadata-derived labels are supplied by the host.

## Working List block

The Working List is distributed to consumers as a source registry block.
Installation copies its production source and required dependencies into the
consumer repository, where the block can be edited in place. The installed
source entry point provides the documented compound component and hooks.

Install it from the GitHub registry in a project with Tailwind CSS enabled and
a valid shadcn `components.json` configuration. The installer uses the
configured `aliases.components` directory as its target:

```sh
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add devotta-labs/dhis2-blocks/working-list
```

Import the installed source through the project's components alias:

```tsx
import {
    WorkingList,
    WorkingListColumnSelector,
    WorkingListFilterControls,
    WorkingListTable,
    WorkingListToolbar,
    WorkingListToolbarActions,
    WorkingListViewSwitcher,
    useWorkingListActions,
    useWorkingListMeta,
    useWorkingListState,
} from '@/components/working-list'
```

The installed components own their styling through Tailwind utility classes;
the block does not require a separate stylesheet import. Adjust the import path
above if the project's components alias differs from `@/components`.

Render `WorkingList` beneath the DHIS2 app-runtime provider and a TanStack
`QueryClientProvider`. The minimal complete composition is:

```tsx
<WorkingList programId={programId} orgUnitId={orgUnitId}>
    <WorkingListViewSwitcher />

    <WorkingListToolbar>
        <WorkingListColumnSelector />
        <WorkingListFilterControls />
        <WorkingListToolbarActions />
    </WorkingListToolbar>

    <WorkingListTable onRowClick={openRecord} />
</WorkingList>
```

View selection and pagination are uncontrolled by default. `WorkingList`
starts with the generated default view, page 1, and 15 rows per page. Use
`defaultViewId` and `defaultPagination` to change those initial values. Optional
change callbacks observe locally managed changes:

```tsx
<WorkingList
    programId={programId}
    orgUnitId={orgUnitId}
    defaultViewId={initialViewId}
    defaultPagination={{ page: 1, pageSize: 25 }}
    onViewChange={persistRecentView}
    onPaginationChange={persistRecentPage}
>
    {/* composition above */}
</WorkingList>
```

Control either state independently when it belongs in a URL, router, or parent
store. A controlled value must include its callback:

```tsx
<WorkingList
    programId={programId}
    orgUnitId={orgUnitId}
    viewId={viewId}
    onViewChange={setViewId}
    pagination={pagination}
    onPaginationChange={setPagination}
>
    {/* composition above */}
</WorkingList>
```

`WorkingListViewSwitcher`, `WorkingListToolbar`, and `WorkingListTable` own safe
localized accessible names. Structural components forward native element props
and `className` for application-specific labeling and layout. `onRowClick` is
optional: without it rows are static; providing it adds mouse and keyboard row
opening. `WorkingListTable` also accepts
`dataQualityMode="hidden" | "highlighted"`.

The public API intentionally exposes only the flat root-prefixed composition
shown above. The earlier compound members and saved-list-named root props are
not supported.

`WorkingList` defaults its instance lifetime to `programId`, so changing the
program resets its uncontrolled state. When rendering multiple working lists,
use React's reserved `key` to give each instance a stable identity:

```tsx
<WorkingList key={workingListKey ?? programId} {...props} />
```

A supplied React key overrides the outer instance identity; changing it replaces
that instance even when `programId` stays the same.

The private block workspace packages remain only as the repository's canonical
development and test harnesses. They are not compiled or publishable consumer
packages.

The root `registry.json` is the public registry entry point. It owns global
metadata and composes each package-owned registry manifest through shadcn's
`include` mechanism. Paths declared by a package manifest are relative to that
package.

## Quality checks

```sh
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm dead-code:audit
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Turborepo runs each task in the workspaces that provide it and caches declared
build outputs.

Unit and component tests use Vitest. Real-DHIS2 browser tests use Playwright.

`pnpm dead-code:audit` runs the complete Knip configuration and fails on any
finding, including circular imports. Use `pnpm audit:exports` for a focused
interactive export report.

## Real-DHIS2 browser tests

The existing version-specific commands remain available from the repository
root:

```sh
pnpm e2e:41
pnpm e2e:42
pnpm e2e:43
pnpm e2e:dev
```
